# Crime_Prediction
1.Classification
Logistic regression gives an accuracy of 69% SVM got an accuracy of 70%

2. Clustering
A silhouette score of 0.68 indicates that the clusters produced by DBSCAN,mean shift,Hierarchical Clusters have relatively good separation as compare to silhouette score of 0.30 that suggests moderate separation among the clusters produced by K-means.
3.Ensemble Classifiers
1.Random Forest Classifier
the model has high precision, recall, and F1-score across multiple classes, with an overall accuracy of 0.97. This suggests that the Random Forest Classifier model performs well on the given dataset.
2.Gradient Boosting
The model has high precision, recall, and F1-score across multiple classes, with an overall accuracy of 0.97. This suggests that the Gradient Boosting Classifier model performs well on the given dataset, similar to the Random Forest Classifier model mentioned earlier. Both models have similar accuracy and performance metrics across different classes.
GRAPHS
1.Performance Metrics Graphs

Generated a set of subplots to visually compare the performance metrics of different classes in a classification report, providing insights into the model's performance across various categories.

2.Density Plot

A density plot to visualize the distribution of crime incidents over time, providing insights into the density or concentration of incidents across the specified time period.

3.Time Series Plot (Trend of Crime Incidents Over Time):

A time series plot to visualize the trend of crime incidents over the specified time period, providing insights into how the number of incidents varies over time.

4.Distribution of Crime Types

A bar chart to visualize the distribution of crime types based on the count of incidents, providing insights into which crime types are most prevalent in the dataset.

5.Hourly Crime Distribution

A bar plot to visualize the distribution of crime incidents by hour of the day, providing insights into the variations in crime activity throughout the day.
